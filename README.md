# Key-Indicators-of-Heart-Disease
EDA and Machine Learning Modeling on the 'Key Indicators of Heart Disease' dataset as featured on Kaggle.
I have performed exploratory data analysis, and ad hoc data analysis on either numerical and categorical features.
I tried to understand the relationship of categorical variables against the target variable 'HeartDisease' via a Chi-Square test.
Finally, I tried a few models to fir our data, in order to be able to predict our target variable.
